I've been coding for about 5 years.  I began by taking a 4-course sequence of
classes with a great a teacher, Sarah Finney, now a Google engineer, in fundamentals,
object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms (all in C/C++).  The project that
got me hooked was making an AI to play the classic arcade game, Pong.

After that I began to teach myself the basics of front-end web development stack
(html, css, JavaScript) and enough PhP/MySQL to be able to create custom
WordPress websites, which I've been doing professionally for 3 years.

Over the last year, I've been spending a lot of time upping  my craft to build,
maintain, and extend web applications using the best contemporary tools and
processes for small-to-medium-sized projects: TDD and agile using Ruby,
JavaScript and their web frameworks.  The culimination of that process will be
doing the MakerSquare immersive code bootcamp for 13 weeks starting July 27th, 2015.
