I've been awarded a [MakerSquare][ms] Fellowship, which will keep me at our Austin campus through the second week of February, 2016.  The Fellowship is designed for people who recently had success in the program and who want to stay on to assist other students and research more advanced topics.  My main responsiblity will be teaching [MakerPrep][msp], a part-time introduction to web development and the fundamentals of programming in JavaScript.  The next class will run [November 9th - December 12th][mp].

For my own learning, I plan on going deeper into

- Data Visualization (using [D3.js][d3])
- Client-Side BDD/TDD for Angular Apps (using [Karma][k], [Jasmine][jas], and [Protractor][pr])
- [Material Design][md] UI/UX solutions for Angular (especially [LumX][lx])
- Goal-Oriented Refactoring (using some of the patterns in [Martin Fowler's book][rf])

I will also be taking MIT's online intro to data science [class][ds] through December and hopefully working through some of the [Wizard Book][sicp] in January and February.

Finally, with a more reasonable schedule, I should blog more!  I am making a commitment to post something at least once a week, every Friday, and slowly ramp up to writing more frequently. (I will also begin to be active on Twitter,[@ignacio_prado78][twit]).
