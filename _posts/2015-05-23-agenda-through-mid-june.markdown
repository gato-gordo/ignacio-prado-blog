I am starting [MakerSquare][ms] here in Austin on July
27th, 2015.  I've started this blog to document some of what I do there, as well
a preparatory work leading up to it.

MakerSquare has it own assigned preparatory work, which I'll receive in mid-June.  Until
then I plan on:

- Finishing <cite>[Eloquent Javscript][ej]</cite> (I had
worked through the first six chapters in preparation for the MakerSquare
technical interview that I had on May 21st)
- Working through daily Ruby and JS "Kata" on [Codewars][cw]
- Beginning to use TDD, through [RSpec][rsp] for Ruby and
[Jasmine][jas] for JS, as I work through code
exercises in above.

I was exposed to TDD and those tools when I took the two parts of [Engineering
Software as a
Service][saas],
a great MOOC version of a course taught at Berkeley by [Armando
Fox][fox] and [Douglas
Patternson][pat] over
fall/winter of 2014-2105.  This summer/fall is about making it stick.
